# Predicting_cancellation_of_hotel_booking

# Objective:
The objective of the project is to build and compare different machine learning models to predict the cancellation of a hotel booking. 

# Data overview: 
The data set consists of 32 attributes and 119390 observations. The dataset needs preprocessing since it consists of missing values and also outlier treatment is required to handle the outliers before building the models.

# Workflow:
Data preprocessing and EDA to understand the dataset  
Handling categorical data and treating the outliers  
Feature encoding & applying techniques of feature importance  
Spitting train and test data set and cross validation using Logistic regression  
Implementing multiple machine learning models and predicting the accuracy  

# Machine learning models implemented:
Logistic regression  
KNN  
Decision tree  
RandomForest  
Naive Bayes
